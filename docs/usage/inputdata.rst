Input dataset structure
=======================

If you are only working using the S3 datasets, it will not be necessary do
anything else than having access to the correct S3 buckets and either
downloading a dataset of choice or using a S3 URL as input to the program.

S3 bucket overview
------------------

mll-flowdata
   Raw MFC fcs data directly uploaded from MLL with hashed ids. Separate panels
   are stored as separate root-level keys in S3 with each containing a
   :file:`case_info.json` with additional metadata.

mll-sommaps
   Any data that has been generated by flowCat as in the current stage. Each
   folder contains named subdirectories that correspond to different runs.

   models
      Information and saved weights from classification models.

   output
      Classification output such as confusion matrices and raw prediction
      values.

   reference_maps
      Maps that are used to initialize node weights for training on individual
      samples.

   sample_maps
      Individual sample maps. A single sample will have one map for each single
      tube.
